# Welcome to my blog

This is the first post on my new site. I'll be sharing thoughts on:

- Development tips and tricks
- Tool recommendations

## Why a blog?

Sometimes Twitter threads just aren't enough. Long-form content deserves a home.

## What's next?

Stay tuned for more content. In the meantime, feel free to explore my [projects](/projects) or connect with me via the [links](/links) page.

```python
# Here's some sample code
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

See you in the next post.
